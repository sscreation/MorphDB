 Block manager is an innovative library which manages on-disk
 blocks inside a file and provides a very simple interface to be used
 for variety of on-disk datastructures. 
 
 It makes writing on-disk based datastructures extremely  easy.
 And lets the developers worry about only implementing the data structure
 rather than on disk data block management.
 
 Provides BlockMgrDiskPtr which behaves almost like in-memory pointer
 Makes translating an in-memory datastructure to become on-disk data
 structure very easy.
 For e.g. take a look at our samples/diskList.c to see a on-disk circurlar
 linked list and how much the code resembles to the in-memory implentation
 of a linked list.


 Complex data structures like B+Tree or a SkipList database on-disk
 could be written without worrying block management aspects like  
       - Finding a free block in the file 
       - Freeing a used block 
       - Expanding existing block to accommodate the datastructure 
       etc.
       - Data integrity
       - And transaction implementation


Features.
       - block management
         -- automatically allocate blocks of various block sizes.
         -- free blocks
       - Range of block sizes from (128 bytes to 4 MB blocks) instead
         of fixed block size.
         - This helps in managing various sizes of data 
       - Automatic de-fragmentation of data.
         - de-fragments the data when the link count for a data exceeds the preset max links
         - data will be automatically defragmented and new bigger blocks
         - will be found.
       - Data integrity check through check sum verification
       - ACID compliance through transactions
